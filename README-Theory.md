1. What is Software?

Software is a collection of programs or instructions that tell a computer how to work.

Types of Software:

System Software → Manages hardware (e.g., Operating Systems like Windows, Linux).

Application Software → User-focused (e.g., MS Word, Chrome, WhatsApp).

Programming Software → Helps developers (e.g., compilers, IDEs).

2. What is Programming? Why do we need it?

Programming = Writing instructions for computers to perform tasks.

Needed for:

Solving problems

Automating tasks

Creating software, websites, games, AI models, etc.

3. What is Code?

Code is the set of instructions written in a programming language.

Example:

print("Hello, World!")

4. What is Syntax?

Syntax = Rules of a programming language that define correct code structure.

Example in Python:

if True:
    print("Valid syntax")

5. Python – High-Level Language

Python is a high-level, interpreted language.

High-level = easy for humans to read/write.

Low-level = close to machine code (harder to read).

6. Applications of Python

Web Development (Django, Flask)

Data Science & Machine Learning (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow)

Automation & Scripting

Cybersecurity Tools

Game Development (Pygame)

Desktop & Mobile Apps

7. Career Opportunities in Python

Python Developer

Web Developer

Data Scientist

Machine Learning Engineer

Cybersecurity Analyst

Automation Engineer

8. What is a Variable?

A variable stores data in memory with a name.

Example:

age = 20
name = "Alice"

9. Data Types in Python

int → integers (10, -5)

float → decimals (3.14, -2.5)

str → strings ("hello")

bool → True / False

list → [1, 2, 3]

tuple → (1, 2, 3)

dict → {"name": "Alice", "age": 20}

10. Operators in Python

Arithmetic Operators

+ Addition

- Subtraction

* Multiplication

/ Division

// Floor Division

% Modulus (remainder)

** Exponent (power)

Example:

print(10 + 5)  # 15
print(10 % 3)  # 1


Relational/Comparison Operators

== Equal to

!= Not equal

> Greater than

< Less than

>= Greater or equal

<= Less or equal

Logical Operators

and → True if both are True

or → True if one is True

not → Negates condition

Assignment Operators

= Assign

+= Add & assign

-= Subtract & assign

*= Multiply & assign

Membership Operators

in, not in

Identity Operators

is, is not

11. Control Statements

if condition → Executes if true

if 10 > 5:
    print("Yes")


if-else → Executes one of two blocks

if 5 > 10:
    print("True")
else:
    print("False")


if-elif-else → Multiple conditions

12. Loops in Python

For Loop – repeat for a fixed range

for i in range(5):
    print(i)


While Loop – repeat until condition is false

n = 1
while n <= 5:
    print(n)
    n += 1


Loop Control

break → exits loop

continue → skips to next iteration

pass → does nothing

13. Strings in Python

Strings are sequences of characters.

Example:

text = "Python"
print(text[0])       # P
print(len(text))     # 6
print(text.upper())  # PYTHON
print(text.lower())  # python

14. String Functions

len() → length

upper() → uppercase

lower() → lowercase

split() → break into words

replace("a", "b") → replace

find("x") → position

Example:

sentence = "Python is fun"
print(sentence.split())   # ['Python', 'is', 'fun']

15. Frontend, Backend, Database

Frontend → User interface (HTML, CSS, JS)

Backend → Logic and server (Python, Java, Node.js)

Database → Stores data (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)

16. Functions in Python

A function is a block of code that performs a task.

Example:

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(5, 3))

17. Factorial Concept

Factorial (n!) = product of all positive integers ≤ n.

Example:

5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120
